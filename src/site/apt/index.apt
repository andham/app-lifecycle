Custom Build Lifecycles for Applications

  This project consists of a series of build extensions, an abstract build extension, an assembly descriptor,
  and a plugin. All of these parts are used to support applying a single, generalized build lifecycle to 
  a large number of applications, all of which make use of plugins that contain similar wiring information
  and are assembled in similar ways.
